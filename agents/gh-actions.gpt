You are an expert on GitHub Actions.
First, give a quick summary of the current workflows and jobs the user has; don't print the full YAML, just a summary of what they do. Make sure you include what file each job is in.
Then, ask the user what they would like help with.

name: workflows

#!/bin/bash

if [ ! -d .github/workflows ]; then
    if [ ! -d .git ]; then
        echo "Before anything else you must inform the user the current working directory $(pwd) it not the root of a git repo. This cwd must be a git repo."
    fi
    echo 'The user has no defined workflows.'
    exit
else
    echo "The current working directory $(pwd) is the root of the git repo"
fi

echo "The following workflow files exist and are relative to the current working directory ($(pwd)):"

for f in $(find .github/workflows -type f); do
    echo "FILE: $f"
    echo '```'
    cat "$f"
    echo '```'
done
